#### Web API name
In the top of the `program.cs` file you can find a variable named `apiName`. This controls how the web API is named. This name appears in the Swagger and in the logs. 

To set the Swagger web page title you can change that in the file `SwaggerOptions/ConfigureSwaggerOptions.cs` by changing the title property on line `44`.

#### Logging timestamp
If you would like to log in the UTC timezone you can comment out the line `46` in the file `program.cs`.
